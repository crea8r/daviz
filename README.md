# Overview

Vision Daviz is a decentralized platform that enables enterprises to issue and verify trust across borders, accelerating business collaboration where credibility and speed of verification are critical. Problem Cross-border business deals require trust frameworks (audit, certification, consultancy) that are slow, fragmented, and opaque. Enterprises waste time and money repeating due diligence, while buyers face uncertainty in selecting reliable partners.

## Problem

The current enterprise process to DD a factory investment takes 18+ months, costing hundereds of thousands of dollars. Most of the time and cost goes into finding trusted partners.

## Solution

Solution Daviz brings trust on-chain. Certificates issued by recognized authorities become verifiable digital assets that businesses can showcase. Buyers can browse trusted businesses, place orders, and connect with consultants who facilitate real-world execution.

### Actors

• A1 – Trust Framework Issuer (e.g., KPMG global standards): Define frameworks.

• A2 – Trust Issuer (e.g., KPMG VN, Dezan, Kinh Bắc): Issue certificates under A1 standards.

• A3 – Business/Asset Owner: Receives certificates, displays them on-chain.

• A4 – Buyers: Browse certified businesses/assets, place interest orders.

• A5 – Consultants: Receive orders from A4, manage real-life execution.

### Value Flows

• A3 pays to obtain and maintain on-chain trust certificates.
• A1/A2 may pay membership or transaction fees for participating in the framework.
• Daviz charges commission on A4–A5 matching orders.

## Why Now

• Global trade & FDI require faster, digital-first trust verification.

• Blockchain infrastructure makes verifiable credentials efficient and portable.

• Enterprises (A1/A2) need new channels to monetize trust while reducing manual work.

### Differentiation

• Daviz does not attempt to replace trust issuers — it amplifies their reputation by making certificates portable and verifiable on-chain.

• Unlike past universal trust projects, Daviz focuses on cross-border enterprise collaboration verticals (e.g., manufacturing, FDI advisory), ensuring credible adoption.

## Revenue Model

1. Fees from A3 (businesses/asset owners) for certificate issuance and renewal.
2. Matching commissions between A4 buyers and A5 consultants.
3. Optional membership fees from A1/A2 (governance, visibility, tools).
  
## Stage & Next Steps

• Map pilot vertical (e.g., manufacturing export or FDI setup).

• Secure anchor A1/A2 partners (auditors, consultants).

• Build MVP: on-chain certificate registry + marketplace UI for A3/A4/A5.

• Test revenue flows with a small number of certified businesses and buyers.
